# Cullergrader
**Cullergrader** is a simple Java GUI made for photographers that groups and exports images based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing" target="_blank">**perceptual similarity**</a> (and timestamps), allowing users to select the best shots from each set of similar, consecutively taken photos.

Like many photographers, I have the habit of taking the same shot multiple times and selecting the best one to keep. However, when going through thousands of photos, this process of culling images is time-consuming, and tools such as <a href="https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka" target="_blank">**Czkawka**</a> (a large inspiration for this project) can detect a few _very similar_ images, but isn't sensitive enough to group _somewhat similar_ bursts.

Cullergrader is named for being a tool that culls and grades* photos. Please note that it doesn't actually _colour grade_ photos.

## Installation

### Prebuilt Executable
1. Cullergrader requires a Java 8 JRE or newer to run
2. A prebuilt executable `.jar` with all libraries bundled is available for download at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PenguinPush/cullergrader/releases)
3. Extract the `.zip` file to any folder and run `cullergrader-<version>.jar` file to begin using Cullergrader

**Note**:
- If you want to view logs in console, please use `run.bat` or `run.sh` depending on your operating system
- **Using console is highly recommended for large batches of images (or on slow drives), as there is no other way to monitor slow hashing progress!**

### Compiling from Source
1. Ensure you have the following installed:
    - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer
    - Apache Maven
2. Clone the repository with:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PenguinPush/cullergrader.git
   cd cullergrader
   ```
3. Build the project with the following command:
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
4. Extract the generated `cullergrader-version.zip` and run as described above

## How to Use
### 1. Open a Folder of Images
Folders can be opened from `File > Open Folder` or with `Ctrl + O`. The first time images are computed, it may take a few minutes (but often less) to hash the images, depending on image count and disk speed. Hashes are cached for future use in `cache.json`, so as long as this file stays intact, future computations of the same images will be nearly instant.

### 2. Calibrate Grouping Settings
Although the default settings are designed to work fine out of the box, depending on many factors in your photo, and your style of photography, manual calibration is often recommended. By adjusting the timestamp and similarity thresholds and hitting `Reload Groups`, you can adjust how your images are grouped until the grouping behaves as expected.
- `Timestamp Threshold` is the amount of seconds between two photos before it counts it as no longer a part of the same photo group, and creates a new group
- `Similarity Threshold` is the percentage of similarity between the hash of two photos. A higher threshold means more tolerance for less similar photos to be in the same group.

### 3. View Photos and Select Best Takes
By clicking on a photo, users can access the `Photo Viewer`, bringing up all individual photos in a group, with the best take marked by a star (which by default is the first image in group). By navigating using either mouse or `arrow keys` (left and right to move between photos, up and down to move between groups) to a photo, they can use the `spacebar` or `Controls > Set Best Take` to change a photo to the best take. 

![images/photo_viewer.png](images/photo_viewer.png)

**Tip:** by hovering on a photo in the photo viewer, you can view its name, seconds between the last photo, and similarity % to the last photo. Use this information to help you calibrate the grouper.

### 4. Export Your Best Takes
Best takes can be exported to a folder using `File > Export Best Takes` or with `Ctrl + S`. After choosing an export folder, the selected best takes will begin copying to that folder!

## Config

Configuration is **optional**. Cullergrader includes sensible defaults for all settings. To customize, create a `config.json` file in the same directory as the executable.

### Default Config
```json
{
    "DARK_THEME": true,
    "CACHE_FILE": "hashes.json",
    "LOG_DIRECTORY": "logs",
    "DEFAULT_FOLDER_PATH": "",
    "HASHING_ENABLED": true,
    "EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT_MINUTES": 60,
    "MAX_THREADS_RATIO": 2,
    "HASHED_WIDTH": 8,
    "HASHED_HEIGHT": 8,
    "TIME_THRESHOLD_SECONDS": 15,
    "SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT": 45,
    "IMAGE_PREVIEW_CACHE_SIZE_MB": 1024
}
```

| `MAX_THREADS_RATIO`            | The fraction of CPU threads the hasher is allowed to multithread. 2 means half your threads, 3 means a third, etc.                                                                                                                         | `int`         |
| `HASHED_WIDTH`                 | The width that images are computed at before hashing, higher values mean more accurate similarity checks at the cost of performance                                                                                                        | `int`         |
| `HASHED_HEIGHT`                | The height that images are computed at before hashing, higher values mean more accurate similarity checks at the cost of performance                                                                                                       | `int`         |

| `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` | The default similarity between two photo hashes before they're counted as a new group. Higher values means more lenience in image similarity (larger groups, less in number). Editable in-app, but will not change the default stored here | `float`       |
| `IMAGE_PREVIEW_CACHE_SIZE_MB`  | Maximum memory (in megabytes) to use for caching image previews. Default 1024 MB (1 GB). Increase for large photo shoots (see Performance Tuning section)                                                                                  | `int`         |

Note: More config options are technically functional, such as `PLACEHOLDER_THUMBNAIL_PATH`, `KEYBIND_SET_BESTTAKE`, or `GRIDMEDIA_LABEL_TEXT_COLOR`, but are not documented here and aren't editable by default due to their configurability not significantly impacting program function. Users are free to explore the source code and add these into `config.json` themselves, and they should work as intended.

## Performance Tuning

For large photo shoots, you can increase the image preview cache size in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "IMAGE_PREVIEW_CACHE_SIZE_MB": 2048
}
```

**Default:** 2048 MB (2 GB)

The preview cache stores scaled thumbnails (240×160) for all image files in memory to avoid re-reading from disk. The cache fills until reaching the configured limit, then stops caching new entries (no eviction).

**Configuration examples:**
- 512 MB = Smaller cache for limited memory systems
- 1024 MB = Moderate cache for typical photo shoots
- 2048 MB = Default (recommended for most users)
- 4096 MB = Very large photo shoots (4000+ files)

The cache applies to all image formats (JPEG, PNG, RAW, etc.) and significantly improves performance when:
- Changing grouping thresholds
- Reloading groups
- Scrolling through large photo sets

The cache clears automatically when loading a new directory.
